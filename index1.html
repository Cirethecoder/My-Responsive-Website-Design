        <h2>Playstation's Growth</h2>
        <h3><i>Play Has No Limits.</i></h3>
        <p>Sony came in with the Sony PlayStation II. A console which when released had exponentially better graphics, and games than the first. The bigger benefit was that it was backward compatible with existing PlayStation 1 games. This made getting the PS2 much more of a bargain. <br> The PS2 was so powerful that Japan initially imposed export restrictions on the PS2. The PS2 was even said to contain parts, especially its powerful graphics hardware, which could be used to simulate the effects of military ballistic missiles! No wonder it became so popular</p>
