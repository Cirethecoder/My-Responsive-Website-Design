        <h2>Sony's Most Recent AD Campaign.</h2>
        <h3><i></i></h3>
        <p>When the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020, Sony launched its PlayStation Play at Home campaign. The concept was simple: for a limited time, anyone with a PlayStation 4 could claim critically-acclaimed games Journey and Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection completely free of charge, no PlayStation Plus subscription required, and they could keep the games forever. The hope was to keep people entertained while they were stuck at home during lockdown, and now Sony is bringing the PlayStation Play at Home Initiative back for 2021.
        <br>
        From March to June, PlayStation fans on PS4 and PS5 can look forward to four months of free games and other offers. Things are getting started on March 1 at 8pm PST, which is when PlayStation fans can claim their free copy of the 2016 Ratchet & Clank remake. Earning positive reviews at the time of its release, the game is a re-imagining of the first Ratchet & Clank game and designed to bring it more in line with the Ratchet & Clank feature film. Anyone interested has until March 31 at 8pm PT to claim it for their collection.</p>
