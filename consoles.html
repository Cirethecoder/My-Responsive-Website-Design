        <h2>The Console War Leader.</h2>
        <h3><i>The Playstation 4</i></h3>
        <p>The PlayStation 4 was released to critical acclaim, with critics praising Sony for acknowledging its consumers' needs, embracing independent game development, and for not imposing the restrictive digital rights management schemes like those originally announced by Microsoft for the Xbox One. Critics and third-party studios, before its launch, also praised the capabilities of the PlayStation 4 in comparison to its competitors; developers described the performance difference between the console and Xbox One as "significant" and "obvious." Heightened demand also helped Sony top global console sales. By October 2019, PS4 became the second best-selling home game console of all time, behind the PlayStation 2.</p>

        <h2>The Snyder Cut Before 2021</h2>
        <h3><i>It Exists We Just Can't Have It :( </i></h3>
        <p>Sony came in with the Sony PlayStation II. A console which when released had exponentially better graphics, and games than the first. The bigger benefit was that it was backward compatible with existing PlayStation 1 games. This made getting the PS2 much more of a bargain. <br> The PS2 was so powerful that Japan initially imposed export restrictions on the PS2. The PS2 was even said to contain parts, especially its powerful graphics hardware, which could be used to simulate the effects of military ballistic missiles! No wonder it became so popular</p>
